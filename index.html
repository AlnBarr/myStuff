                <p>Hi, you have arrived here before we are ready. This is a placeholder for the Own The Grey website. In time we aim to develop this into a hub for people who have decided to stop fighting the signs of ageing and to “Own the Grey”. I believe
                    that Older People have a lot to offer and are capable of learning new skills like HTML and CSS, perhaps even JavaScript. If I am right I will begin to expand this page into a much fuller site with resources and encouragement for those
                    who visit. It may take months or even years, as I have a full-time job, at least for the next few years until retirement arrives. Perhaps you will find your way back to this page in a little while and it will have transformed into
                    something more interesting. In the meanwhile why not click this link and go on an adventure across the internet.
